# Devember Project
Metroidvania project created for the Devember challenge
by **Stephen Campbell**

## What is Devember?
[Devember](https://devember.org/) is a month-long programming challenge that involves the development and subsequent open source release of a project. I have kept a daily work log on my [blog](https://stephencampbell.me/tag/devember).

## What is this project?
This project is a 2D [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) platformer game, created using the open source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine. As a result, this game should run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, the web via WebGL and BSD.

### Feature set
- 2D platforming with jumping, double jump, gravity, wall jumping and double jumping
- Combat with mouse aim and multiple fire modes
- AI including use of raycasting to check player visibility
- Player pick ups and unlockable player abilities
- Save and load

## How do I run it?
Open the _src_ folder in Godot and everything else should be taken care of. This game currently requires a mouse and keyboard.

### Controls
- WASD to move
- Space to jump
- Mouse aim
- Click to fire
- E to switch weapons
- W to interact with checkpoints
